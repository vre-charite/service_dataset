        Have you chosen the right folder (with 'sub-*/' subfolders)? Check for structural/naming issues and presence of at least one subject.",
    "NOT_INCLUDED": "Files with such naming scheme are not part of BIDS specification. \
        This error is most commonly caused by typos in file names that make them not BIDS compatible. \
            Please consult the specification and make sure your files are named correctly. \
                If this is not a file naming issue (for example when including files not yet covered by the BIDS specification) \
                    you should include a '/.bidsignore' file in your dataset (see https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator#bidsignore for details). \
                        Please note that derived (processed) data should be placed in /derivatives folder and source data (such as DICOMS or behavioural logs in proprietary formats) should be placed in the /sourcedata folder.",
